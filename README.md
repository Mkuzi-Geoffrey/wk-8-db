# Clinic Booking System

## ðŸ§¾ Description

The **Clinic Booking System** is a MySQL-based relational database that models the key components of a clinic or small hospital. It allows the management of patients, doctors, appointments, specializations, rooms, and prescriptions. The system enforces data integrity through proper use of primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and suitable relationships between entities (1-1, 1-M, M-M).

This database can be used by a backend developer as the foundation for a full-stack application, or for learning purposes in understanding relational data modeling in healthcare systems.
